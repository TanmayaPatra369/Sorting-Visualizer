# 🔢 Sorting Visualizer

![Sorting Visualizer Banner](https://steady-khapse-fdc88a.netlify.app/preview.png) <!-- Optional: Replace with actual screenshot -->

An interactive web application to **visualize sorting algorithms** in real-time, built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Vite**. This project helps you understand the inner workings of popular sorting algorithms through dynamic, animated visualizations.

🔗 **Live Demo**: [https://steady-khapse-fdc88a.netlify.app](https://steady-khapse-fdc88a.netlify.app)
